# Sorting_algorithms

## Description
The project covers the following areas
+ Four different sorting algorithms
+ The Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
+ Determining the best sorting algorithm for a given input
+ What is a stable sorting algorithm

## Requirements
+ All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
+ A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
+ Code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
+ No more than 5 functions per file
+ Unless specified otherwise, you are not allowed to use the standard library.
+ The main.c files are examples for testing.
+ The prototypes of all functions should be included in your header file called sort.h
+ All your header files should be include guarded
+ A list/array does not need to be sorted if its size is less than 2.
